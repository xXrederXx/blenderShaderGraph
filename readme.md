# Blender Shader Graph

A cross-language experiment integrating a **graphical shader editor for Blender**, combining a **Python-based GUI** with **C# backend logic**. This tool aims to provide a node-based interface for shader generation, similar to Unity's Shader Graph, but in the context of Blender.
